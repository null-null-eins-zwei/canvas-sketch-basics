## Tool: [canvas-sketch](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch) and [canvas-sketch-util](https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch-util)

`canvas-sketch` is a loose collection of tools, modules and resources for creating generative art in JavaScript and the browser.

### canvas-sketch-util
Utilities for generative art in Canvas, WebGL and JavaScript.

This is designed to be used alongside the canvas-sketch toolset, but it is generic enough to work for various Node.js/Browser use cases.

* npm install canvas-sketch-util --save
* https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch-util

### Animation export
* We can save anything we draw with `Ctrl + S`.
* By default export save in `Download` folder. To set another folder, use `--output` flag.
* When you use `Ctrl + Shift + S` to export an animation, it will begin recording *image frames as separate files* and log progress in the browser console. You can hit this keystroke again to stop recording.
* To save animation as video we need ffmpeg: 
  * `npm install @ffmpeg-installer/ffmpeg --global`
* Run with video-export mode: `canvas-sketch canvas-sketch-demo.js --output=output/stream-demo --stream`
